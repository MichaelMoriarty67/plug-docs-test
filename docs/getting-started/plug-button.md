# Plug Authentication Button

![](imgs/button.png)

The Plug Connect button is a basic React Component button you can use to integrate Plug's `Agent` features for authenticating a user's identity and requesting access to the Plug Agent to sign requests to your canisters on behalf of that identity.

The following example doesn't include the proxy signing requests per-se, just the initial authentication and request for the agent.

You can find the repository of Plug Connect [here](https://github.com/Psychedelic/plug-connect).

## Requirements ü§î

You'll be required to have:

- Basic knowledge of [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- A React >= 16 project to import the [Plug Connect](https://github.com/Psychedelic/plug-connect/packages/919824) package
- A [Github](https://github.com) user account
- Basic knowledge of NPM via the command-line
- [NPM configured](#npm-configuration) to fetch from Github's [@Psychedelic](https://github.com/orgs/Psychedelic/packages) registry


## ‚öôÔ∏è NPM configuration

The [Plug Connect](https://github.com/Psychedelic/plug-connect/packages/919824) package is in the [Github Package Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry) and not in the [NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/)! This is important to note as we keep our projects under the [@Psychedelic organisation](https://github.com/psychedelic) on Github, our official channel for our projects.

To pull and install the Plug Connect package from [@Psychedelic](https://github.com/psychedelic) via the NPM CLI, you'll need:

- A personal access token (you can create a personal acess token [here]((https://github.com/settings/tokens)))
- The personal access token with the correct scopes, **repo** and **read:packages** to be granted access to the [GitHub Package Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).

- Authenticate via `npm login`, using your Github email for the **username** and the **personal access token** as your **password**:

Once you have those ready, run:

```
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --scope=@Psychedelic
```

!!! Note
    
    You only need to configure this once to install the package!
    On npm login provide your Github email as your username and the Personal access token as the password.

## Using the package üéÅ

Make sure you have followed the simple instructions for configuring your [NPM CLI](#npm-configuration), as our packages are hosted outside NPM's registry.

If you have already, in your project root, add the package (we're using yarn but npm can be used):

```
yarn add @psychedelic/plug-connect
```

Once added, you'll be able to import the Plug Connect package by:

```js
import PlugConnect from '@psychedelic/plug-connect';
```

To Use the component, you can simply do:

```js
<PlugConnect
  onConnectCallback={() => console.log("Some callback")}
/>
```

For example, let's say that you want to get the user's identity on connect:

```js
<PlugConnect
  onConnectCallback={
    () => console.log(window.ic.plug.agent.getPrincipal())
  }
/>
```

Here's how it'll look like in the **default light mode**:

The props `dark` and `title` are also supported:

```js
<PlugConnect
  dark
  onConnectCallback={() => console.log("Some callback")}
  title="My title"
/>
```

Here's how it'll look like in **dark mode**:

## Conclusion

We're currently working hard to bring more features and plan to release them as soon as they become ready.

The project is [open-source](https://github.com/Psychedelic/plug-connect) and you are very welcome to participate or follow the progress!
