Welcome to Plug's developer documentation. Learn how to integrate Plug into Internet Computer applications to provide **seamless onboardings and transactions with a user's Principal ID wallet**. 

**Important**: Plug is currently in development, and is soon to be released to the public as a browser extension. This is a placeholder documentation and will be updated with the final interfaces/guides on release.

Plug is a browser crypto wallet & identity/authentication provider for the Internet Computer, compatible with Cycles, ICP, and soon will allow anyone to add any Internet Computer token to it.

## Why use Plug in your IC app?
Plug helps developers offer seamless web/app experiences on the Internet Computer, handling authentication and wallet connection for their users. The same experience a Dapp user would expect on Ethereum, but built for the Internet Computer.

- A browser crypto wallet extension.
- A seamless authentication provider.
- A convenient address book for IC addresses.

This is because Plug lets anyone hold Cycles & ICP, with a  **Principal IDs only, eliminating the need of a separate Cycle Canister Wallet**. This is done using the [Dank Open Internet Service](https://dank.ooo) and cycles ledger, and by abstracting the use of Account IDs in the case of ICP; also adhering to a community-set standards for using Principal IDs as a user's unique identifier on the Internet Computer

## One-click Transactions & Asset Management

By integrating Plug, developers can also trigger transactions that interact with a user's Plug wallet balances (ICP, Cycles, etc...). The core perk of Plug, without doubt, is being a simple interface for **Cycle and ICP operations**.

Developers can seamlessly build cycle-billing systems, trigger transaction based on app-usage, or other asset/cycle finances via easy-to-call methods on Plug; which the user will receive as a visual prompt on their browser, and confirm to sign and sends.

## Seamless User Authentication
Plug allows resolves the issue of having **separate authentication flows in IC apps** for a user's Principal ID, and their Cycle Wallets or ICP balances by using the Dank Open Internet Service to allow users to hold Cycles with just a Principal ID, and abstracting the use of Account IDs in the case of ICP.

Plug is an alternative identity provider to Internet Identity, that allows users to use a single unique identifier (Principal ID) across all applications and services, instead of using app/device specific identities, and separate addresses for different asset/token balances.

Since now a user can have their Principal ID as both their wallet/identity as **one main account** developers will only to interact with Plug and initiate a connection to the user's Plug wallet, authenticating them (and their balances) in one single and simple step to your platform.

## Convenient Browser Wallet & Address Book
From a user's perspective, Plug provides the best experience for managing their **Internet Computer balances & identity** across the network, and its applications, using only a Principal ID.

Any user can easily access their ICP, Cycles, and other tokens (soon) balances from a browser interface, and **perform ICP/Cycle actions** like sending to other addresses, depositing, or swapping ICP for Cycles in one click. 

**Finally, Plug also includes an Address Book** that anyone can use to keep easy record of the people they send cycles or ICP to, or canisters they deposit cycles to. Saves time, prevents mistakes, and helps keep your close contacts at reach when making a transaction in Plug.
