Welcome to Plug's developer documentation. Learn how to integrate Plug into Internet Computer applications to provide **seamless onboardings and transactions with a user's Principal ID wallet**.

Plug is a browser crypto wallet and identity/authentication provider for the Internet Computer, compatible with ICP, and soon with cycles and any Internet Computer token. **[Read our intro article to learn all about it!](https://medium.com/@plug_wallet/b14c7692586?source=friends_link&sk=70eef990c3ee7fd5e0a828651cbc2096)**

## Important:

**Plug is currently in Alpha V0.1.0**, and that early version **doesn't include developer integrations / interactions**, therefore **this documentation is currently a placeholder** and doesn't contain Plug's interfaces/guides.

We will release **V0.2.0 in the upcoming weeks**, which will be the version that will make **Plug integratable to IC apps as an authentication provider** and to request transactions/balances from the app to the user's wallet. When we do so, we will update this documentation to add all guides, interfaces, and app examples.

## Why Plug? What is different?
Plug aims to solve several points of friction on the Internet Computer for both developers and users.

**For users?** It means having one main wallet (your Principal ID) in your browser to manage all your assets (Cycles/ICP/tokens, NFT's, etc.) and to log into any IC app. No need to worry about having separate wallets for different apps and tokens, or having multiple identities per device/app (like you would when using Internet Identity).

- Log into IC apps from your browser in one click using the same Principal ID.
- Manage, send and receive all your IC assets from one place, with one ID.
- Save contacts (aka name ID's) in a local storage address book. 


**For developers?** It will help offer seamless web/app experiences on the Internet Computer, handling authentication and wallet connection for their users. The same experience a Dapp user would expect on Ethereum, but built for the Internet Computer.

- Authenticate users, and their balances, in one click with just a Principal ID.
- Trigger transfers or transaction requests to user's wallets from apps.
- Query and display a user's balances in the app.
